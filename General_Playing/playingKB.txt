information I found while playing with the kinetics.py parameters

As Eric mentioned in class, the real infection rate of COVID-19 in idaho has weekly cyclical spike due to testing results from weekends. This must be kept in mind while playing with the model.

I played specifically with the idaho_infections.csv data

with the base parameters(0.3,0.04), the model infected peak reaches just over 1 million at ~60 days

Parameters (0.4,0.04)
