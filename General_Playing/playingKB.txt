information I found while playing with the kinetics.py parameters

As Eric mentioned in class, the real infection rate of COVID-19 in idaho has weekly cyclical spike due to testing results from weekends. This must be kept in mind while playing with the model.

I played specifically with the idaho_infections.csv data

with the base parameters(0.3,0.04), the model infected peak reaches just over 1 million at ~60 days

Parameters (0.4,0.04), mildly increasing infection rate with same recovery rate,results in a higher spike in infections (~1.2 mil) sooner at ~49 days.This model seems to progress much too fast compared to the data of the past month in ID.

Parameters (0.1,0.02), tried these to make closer to graph of current real data, pushed the peak to ~800,000 at ~200 days. Didn't move fast enough initially to match the outbreak.

Parameters(0.15,0.04), tried these to get closer to the graph of real data, pushed the peak to ~675,000 at ~140 days. Growth still doesnt match very close initially.

Parameters(0.15, 0.04) but changed initial people infected to 3.
